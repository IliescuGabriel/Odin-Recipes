        <p>Rich and creamy, this chicken curry has a deliciously moreish nutty taste thanks to a generous dollop of our crunchy All-Natural Peanut Butter. Who knew such a simple addition could make such a difference?</p>
        <p>Making a curry from scratch might sound daunting at first, but Niall’s here to show it doesn’t have to take a load of obscure ingredients and hours of your time to prepare. Plus, when the end result tastes this good, it’s more than worth your effort.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp. 100% Coconut Oil</li>
            <li>400g chicken breast (cubed)</li>
            <li>1 onion (sliced)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 thumb-sized piece ginger (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 red chilli (deseeded and finely chopped)</li>
            <li>5 tbsp. curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tin chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 handful fresh coriander (chopped)</li>
            <li>400ml light coconut milk</li>
            <li>100g All-Natural Peanut Butter (Crunchy)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>To serve:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basmati rice (around 75g per person)</li>
            <li>Chopped peanuts</li>
            <li>Coriander</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, heat the coconut oil in a large pan and add the chicken. Season lightly and fry until cooked through and golden brown on the outside, then set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now, add the onion and fry until soft. Add the chopped garlic, ginger, and chilli and fry for another 1-2 minutes before adding the curry powder and a large splash of water. Bring to a simmer, stir well and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now, add the chopped tomatoes and coriander, give it a good stir and leave to simmer for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Gradually stir in the light coconut milk to the sauce and then add your crunchy peanut butter. Give it all really good stir, and leave to simmer on a low heat until your curry has reached your desired consistency.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve with basmati rice and a sprinkling of chopped coriander and peanuts, then enjoy!</li>
